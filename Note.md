# Database
Non-relational databases might be the right choice if:
- Your application requires super-low latency.
- Your data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data.
- You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.).
- You need to store a massive amount of data.

## Database replication
- A master database generally only supports write operations.
- A slave database gets copies of the data from the master database and only supports read operations.
-  All the data-modifying commands like insert, delete, or update must be sent to the master database. Most applications require a much higher ratio of reads to writes; thus, the number of slave databases in a system is usually larger than the number of master databases.
